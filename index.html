        <h2>HOW TO PLAY?</h2>
        <p>The game is super easy.</p>
        <p>You have an inventory with some objects and bins. You have to put every object in the corresponding bin..</p><br>
        <h2>GAME LOGIC</h2>
        <p>The game logic is scripted in Microlanguage, but it was converted to JS. This language allows us to create a video game on a website, but don't forget about CSS for the graphics and HTML for the functioning of the website!</p>
        <p>Basically, I created multiple sprites and assigned a variable named [TYPE]point[NUMBER] to the sprites to make this variable TRUE. If it is TRUE, then display the point sprite.</p><br>
        <h2>GAME DEVELOPERS</h2>
        <p>These two humans are the developers of the game.</p>
